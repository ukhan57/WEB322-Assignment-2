                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Death Note is a Japanese television drama anime series based on the manga series of the same name by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. The show is centered around Light Yagami - a promising highschooler and aspiring detective with a strong sense of "justice".</p>

                                "It the most amazing anime I've ever seen.
                                It was a thrilling and amazing experience to watch this anime series. The ending was fitting to the characters, especially Yagami light. At the same time, it was sad to see the end of the main protagonist dying at such young age by having no one by his side. Another interesting and heart throbbing character was the L, his skills as the detective was topnotch. The lesson of the series is well conveyed, no matter how much injustice is in the society we can't take the law in our hands."</p>

                                        If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks.
